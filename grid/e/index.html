        <li style="grid-area: A;">Do not go gentle into that good night,</li>
        <li style="grid-area: B;">Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</li>
        <li style="grid-area: C;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: D;">Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</li>
        <li style="grid-area: E;">Because their words had forked no lightning they</li>
        <li style="grid-area: F;">Do not go gentle into that good night.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: G;">Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: H;">Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</li>
        <li style="grid-area: I;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: J;">Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</li>
        <li style="grid-area: K;">And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</li>
        <li style="grid-area: L;">Do not go gentle into that good night.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: M;">Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</li>
        <li style="grid-area: N;">Blind eyes could blaze like 4 meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: O;">And you, my father, there on the sad height,</li>
        <li style="grid-area: P;">Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: Q;">Do not go gentle into that good night.</li>
        <li style="grid-area: R;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
